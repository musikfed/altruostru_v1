Your website is your asset and it needs to constantly be protected from various security issues, server issues, hacking, etc. While you take all precautionary steps to protect your website, backups are the best form of security. With Backuply, you can be confident that your data is protected and is always available for restore during any disaster. Backuply creates full backups of your website and you can restore it to the same or a new WordPress website with the click of a button.

== Backups ==
Backup is a way of copying your data or files to a secure place, which can be used to restore your website in case of data loss. Backups are vital in securing the data that you have published or written. Backups with Backuply are easy and secure with support for multiple options of storage like local storage using FTP or using third-party services like Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, AWS S3 and WebDAV.
To make it even easier we support Automatic Backups with a customizable backup schedule.


== Restores == 
Restoring is just a One-Click process using Backuply. If the selected backup is available then Backuply will restore your backups safely. Restoring a backup will roll back your site in the exact same state as it was when the backup was created.


== Migration ==
Backuply creates a tar file of your whole WordPress install with the Database, so you can migrate your site to any host or location where WordPress can be installed. All you need to do is create a Backup of your WordPress install on a remote location, and that's it, It can be synced on any WordPress install with ease so you just need to restore the synced backup on the new location for Migration to happen.
