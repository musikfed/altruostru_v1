Send emails from your WordPress site using your preferred SMTP provider like Gmail, Outlook, AWS, Zoho, SMTP.com, Sendinblue, Mailgun, Postmark, Sendgrid, Sparkpost, Sendlayer or any custom SMTP provider.

== Description ==

GoSMTP allows you to send emails from your WordPress over SMTP or many of the popular email sending services. Many web hosting companies have strict mail sending rules and limitations which restrict email deliverability. With GoSMTP, you will not be using your hosting providers PHP email but rather sending emails over SMTP or using API's of various email providers.

GoSMTP supports many of your preferred SMTP provider(s) :
1) Gmail, Gsuite, Google Workspace
2) Outlook / Office 365
3) AWS
4) Zoho
5) SMTP.com
6) Sendinblue
7) Mailgun, Postmark
8) Sendgrid
9) Sparkpost
10) Sendlayer
11) Or any custom SMTP provider

WordPress uses the PHP mail function to send emails generated by WordPress. The PHP mail function sends emails over the IP of your hosting provider's servers which can have a bad reputation and be blacklisted by many email providers like Gmail, Yahoo, Office 365, Zoho, etc. causing your WordPress originated emails to land in the SPAM folder of your users. By using GoSMTP you ensure that your emails reach the inbox of your user(s).
